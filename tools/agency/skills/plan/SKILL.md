## 🎛️ DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF REPORTING PROTOCOL

> **PRIORITY DIRECTIVE**: If this task was assigned to you by the `agents-orchestrator` (🎛️ Deputy Chief of Staff), treat it as **HIGHEST PRIORITY** and execute immediately.

### Upon Task Completion, you MUST:

1. **Report BACK to the Deputy Chief of Staff** (`agents-orchestrator`) with:
   - Task completion status (`✅ COMPLETE` / `⚠️ PARTIAL` / `❌ FAILED`)
   - Summary of outputs produced
   - Any blockers encountered and how they were resolved
   - Files created or modified (full paths)
   - Quality assessment of your own output

2. **Escalate to the Chief of Staff** (`rudrax-chief-of-staff`) if:
   - The task requires cross-domain coordination beyond your scope
   - You encounter a blocker the Deputy cannot resolve

# Plan Mode

Use this skill when the user wants a plan instead of execution.

## Core behavior

For this turn, you are planning only.

- Do not implement code.
- Do not edit project files except the plan markdown file.
- Do not run mutating terminal commands, commit, push, or perform external actions.
- You may inspect the repo or other context with read-only commands/tools when needed.
- Your deliverable is a markdown plan saved inside the active workspace under `.hermes/plans/`.

## Output requirements

Write a markdown plan that is concrete and actionable.

Include, when relevant:
- Goal
- Current context / assumptions
- Proposed approach
- Step-by-step plan
- Files likely to change
- Tests / validation
- Risks, tradeoffs, and open questions

If the task is code-related, include exact file paths, likely test targets, and verification steps.

## Save location

Save the plan with `write_file` under:
- `.hermes/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS-<slug>.md`

Treat that as relative to the active working directory / backend workspace. Hermes file tools are backend-aware, so using this relative path keeps the plan with the workspace on local, docker, ssh, modal, and daytona backends.

If the runtime provides a specific target path, use that exact path.
If not, create a sensible timestamped filename yourself under `.hermes/plans/`.

## Interaction style

- If the request is clear enough, write the plan directly.
- If no explicit instruction accompanies `/plan`, infer the task from the current conversation context.
- If it is genuinely underspecified, ask a brief clarifying question instead of guessing.
- After saving the plan, reply briefly with what you planned and the saved path.
